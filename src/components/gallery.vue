    <h1>The Gallery</h1>

    <p>In a Realm where success can depend largely on the keenness of your eye, it is oft told that studying thy enemy closely can reveal more than a passing glance... but sometimes, it's best if someone just draws a picture.</p>

    <p>Many of Astaria's renowned adventurers throughout its vibrant past have also provided a face to associate with their name. The Astarian gallery consists of artwork, photos, and a few other random pieces.</p>

    <p>All images in the gallery are property of HoC Productions, though licensing is the last thing on our minds - so we've just given credit if it was provided!</p>
